# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Understanding the code

This section is targeted towards developers

## The systems

The overall systems in the frontend is designed to support the desired flow of Process Mining professor Andrea Burratin.

### Processes

Processes is a javascript object located in local memory that has information of which foreign process is running. From the frontend, this is used to determine the state of the foreign process, and when to retreive the results. To create a process, create a process object, and save it to localmemory. In App.jsx, exists an interval, that will ping running processes, thus keeping the system up to date with all processes created from the current unit. 

### Files

Tied in with processes are files, which has two components: Metadata and content.

#### Metadata

The file metadata is a javascript object, that has relevant information pretaining to a file. The contents is used to display information in various areas of the frontend, and helped to determine that type, visualization posibilities and completion state of a file. Much of the information is also used to determine if communcation is necessary with either the producer, or the repository that holds it.

#### Content

The file contents are important for certain file types. This will be the actual text, image or other that the file consists of. For log files, we don't want to save it on the frontend, but BPMN is necessary to visualize the model. The contents is added to the file Metadata in local memory.
